 def test() {                                                                                                                                           
     List<Question> questions = Question.list(max: 2, offset: 2)
     render questions

leave 2(offset) records of the question list obtained and then show max (2) records(start showinf from 3rd record),
           
offset means from where to start showing the records and then next time if in paginate tag                               
    
, suppose total records are 10 then the offset initially was 2 and 2 (max)records displayed ie 4 records are displayed..                        
     
paginate tag will now set offset to 4 automatically and then 2 more elements would be displayed(max)..                                           
     
and similarly the paginate tag will manage , if no paginate tag is used then                                                                     
     
we need to explicitly generate the offset...                                                                                                     
    
which is offset=max + offset
